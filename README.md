# VERJava

> This research represents my first independently completed scientific endeavor during my doctoral studies.
> The dataset was made publicly available in 2022, and recently, several researchers have expressed interest in reproducing the code.
> As a result, I have decided to open-source the code associated with the paper.


## What is VERJava?

Open source the code and data from our paper **'VERJava: Vulnerable Version Identification for Java OSS with a Two-Stage Analysis (ICSME 2022)'**

In light of the prevalent inaccuracies and omissions in version ranges within existing vulnerability databases such as NVD, we have provided **VERJava**, _an automated tool for assessing the actual impact versions of vulnerabilities within given Java CVE_.

We have made the dataset openly available, and at the time of its release in 2022, https://github.com/sunSUNQ/VERJava_Dataset, it was the sole dataset in the industry to encompass vulnerability impact version ranges. The annotation of this dataset required significant time and human resources, and we have chosen to open-source it as a contribution to the open-source community.
